    A talk by David Fullerton I attended at DeveloperWeek 2019
  

    </p>
  </header>

  <p>One of the really interesting things about this talk was how candid it was. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s about getting something out there that isn&#39;t perfect, learning what&#39;s not working, and having the courage to go back and rebuild the parts that aren&#39;t working.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="doing-just-enough">Doing Just Enough</h2>
<p>All of StackOverflow runs on 9 web servers and 4 SQL Server boxes.</p>
<p>An example is how they managed tag search. In the early days, instead of building a complicated tag management system, they simply did a <code>CONTAINS</code> statement in SQL. However, this doesn&#39;t work with special characters. Rather than complicate things, the simply substituted the special characters for word characters they weren&#39;t using (e.g. <code>c#</code> → <code>cñ</code>). This lasted a couple years, and solved the problem simply and quickly.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: An early hack that solves a problem quickly can actually sustain you for a long time. Eventually, you may need to rebuild it, but you can do so with the full use case in mind.</p>
<h2 id="scaling-the-community">Scaling the Community</h2>
<p>One of StackOverflow&#39;s biggest challenges hasn&#39;t been scaling technically, it&#39;s been scaling the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[As the community grows], the biggest thing you start to lose is a sense of empathy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>StackOverflow has long has this culture of &quot;being right is more important than being helpful.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ended up being one of the biggest challenges to scaling the community. They had to change the community to drive towards helpfulness as a shared value.</p>
<p>The motto used to be &quot;StackOverflow is for professional programmers.&quot; This exclude a lot of people who don&#39;t feel like they belong to this group. It drives people away from the industry. This also hurts people from underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>They&#39;re working to &quot;refactor a community.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>This year, they rolled out a new code of conduct that emphasizes &quot;kindness, collaboration and mutual respect.&quot;</li>
<li>They added a way to enforce the code of conduct by adding a new flag (unfriendly or unkind).</li>
<li>They added a new contributor indicator to remind the community to be nice to someone who&#39;s new.</li>
</ul>
<p>The net change so far is new, unkind comments has dropped by a third.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These things have a connection thread of a willing to go back and revisit old decisions. StackOverflow&#39;s success is driven by a willingness to listen to what people say and change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask the right questions, and be willing to listen to the answers you get.</p>
</blockquote>
