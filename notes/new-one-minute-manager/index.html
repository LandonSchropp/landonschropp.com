  <p>When it comes to managers, there&#39;s the &quot;tough&quot; autocrat and the &quot;nice&quot; democrat. You need both perspectives to be a good manager.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>The goal is to facilitate in helping others to make decisions, not to make the decisions for them. You should <em>show</em> an individual how to do something, not do it for them.</p>
<p>After a while, you shouldn&#39;t need participate as much. Your aim is to build autonomy and self-reliance, which necessitates stepping back.</p>
<p>Goals should be described briefly and clearly. Part of the manager&#39;s job is to define what good performance looks like. Ask the employee to review their goals each day, and to look at what they&#39;re doing and see if it&#39;s in line. If someone&#39;s behavior is out of line with their goals, ask them to re-evaluate it so they can realize their goals sooner.</p>
<h2 id="praisings">Praisings</h2>
<p>Your aim is to show in <em>very specific terms</em> what a person is and isn&#39;t doing well. It&#39;s a lot easier for someone to do well if they have crystal clear feedback on how they&#39;re doing. Feedback is an invaluable too—it will help them succeed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help people reach their full potential—catch them doing something right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Praise should happen <em>as soon as possible</em>. When you notice someone doing something right, tell they precisely what it was and how good it made you feel. By specifying exactly what someone is doing, they know you&#39;re being sincere. It also shows consistency.</p>
<p>Finally, you should pause to let the other person feel good, make it clear you have confidence in them and encourage them to do more of the same.</p>
<h2 id="redirects">Redirects</h2>
<p>The purpose of a redirect is to help someone get back on track and achieve their goals. There&#39;s respect and caring behind a redirect.</p>
<p>Let the other person know what the facts of the mistake were and review it together. <em>Be very specific.</em> Then, walk the other person through how you <em>feel</em> about it and its possible impact on the team results. </p>
<p>Give the other person a few moments of quiet time to think about it. Then, remind the other person that you feel they&#39;re better than one mistake, you have confidence and trust in them, and you don&#39;t expect a repeat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you have to care enough to be tough—that is, tough on the poor performance but not the person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By reaffirming your value of the person, it makes it easier to not react negatively to the redirect. You want build confidence in others. When the redirect is over, it&#39;s over.</p>
<p>Personally, I like two things about the redirect.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it implies a small change. It allows you to not feel authoritarian.</li>
<li>Second, it&#39;s a <em>service</em> to the other person. When done right, it can be appreciated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>Isn&#39;t the &quot;one minute&quot; thing a little hokey? Can all feedback really be confined to one minute?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course not. But it&#39;s a way to make a complicated job more manageable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feedback is the number one motivator of people. People shouldn&#39;t have to wait for their performance reviews to get it.</p>
<p>Also, it&#39;s not effective to store up observations of poor behavior. When that happens, people usually end up disagreeing with the facts, or they stay quiet and become resentful.</p>
<p>Punishment doesn&#39;t work when someone is learning. All it does is discourage them from stretching. Redirects allow us to change behavior without killing motivation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are first touch on the behavior, and <em>then</em> supportive of the person, it works better.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When our self-concept is under attack, we feel a need to defend ourselves and our actions, even to the extent of distorting the facts.</p>
</blockquote>
