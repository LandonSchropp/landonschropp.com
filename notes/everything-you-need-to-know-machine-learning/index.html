  <h2 id="1-identify-the-problem-you-want-to-solve">1. Identify the Problem You Want to Solve</h2>
<p>Types of machine learning problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supervised:</strong> You can use past data to derive answers to future problems.</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised:</strong> The data set doesn&#39;t have any answers and the object is to find some structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>You usually start with an unsupervised model to identify the structure, and then use supervised as the product.</p>
<p>There are two types of supervised problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classification:</strong> The answer is a discreet value.</li>
<li><strong>Regression:</strong> The answer can be any continuous value.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can frame your problem as a classification or regression problem, then it&#39;s a good candidate for machine learning.</p>
<p>Machine learning is resource expensive, so if there&#39;s a simple heuristic system that&#39;s &quot;good enough,&quot; then use that.</p>
<h2 id="2-frame-the-problem-as-a-machine-learning-model">2. Frame the Problem as a Machine Learning Model</h2>
<p>It&#39;s really helpful to include a problem domain expert on the team.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prediction target:</strong> The thing your model is trying to predict. Everyone needs to agree on this. This can be harder to determine than it seems. You should codify and unit test this.</li>
<li><strong>Labeled data:</strong> You need a data set where you know the answers. </li>
<li><strong>Data preprocessing:</strong> Transform the data to a format that works for your model. As an example, you can use <em>normalization</em> to get all of your data into the same range. This is important when weighing parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong> The parameters you want to include in your algorithm. </li>
<li><strong>Acceptance criteria:</strong> You need to know: &quot;when will my model be good enough?&quot; This is usually in terms of accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also want to include data points from a wide variety of situations so you don&#39;t introduce bias in your model.  You also need to be careful that you don&#39;t encode biases that are already in the system. You can algorithmically generate data from a smaller data set in some cases (such as applying distortion to text input.)</p>
<p>When choosing features, mix your own intuition with statistical analysis. <q>Could a human expert confidently predict the outcome given these pieces of information?</q> You need to evaluate the quality of the data for long-term consistency. This is an ongoing process.</p>
<h2 id="3-train-the-model">3. Train the Model</h2>
<p>Many times libraries will do this for you. The process is also usually well-documented.</p>
<h2 id="4-productizing-the-model">4. Productizing the Model</h2>
<p>PMML is a standardized language for expressing a machine learning model and its results. Most languages have packages that can interpret it.</p>
<p>After training your model, you need to verify its accurate. The first step is to figure out the accuracy of your model in comparison to a test set of data.</p>
<p>You can also release your model in &quot;shadow mode,&quot; where it&#39;s making predictions but isn&#39;t actually sharing those with the user. You need to do this every time you do an update to your model.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll also want to have alerting set up for your algorithm&#39;s accuracy. And automate the pipeline as much as possible.</p>
<p>More likely than not, your first model will be bad. You have to be willing to see it as a process and be willing to iterate.</p>
<p>In the future, Tensorflow allows you to deploy a model to GKE and then make predictions in real time. If you&#39;re just starting out, Tensorflow has a low barrier to entry.</p>
